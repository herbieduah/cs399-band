                    <h5>Bass Guitar</h5>

                    <p>Justin started playing music yesterday. The bass guitar works well for him
                        since
                        he can
                        pretend to play and no one can tell the difference. He's hoping he never
                        has a
                        solo...</p>

                    <p>Justin loves the outdoors. He and his wife are often on an adventure
                        exploring
                        northern Arizona.</p>

                    <h5>Drums</h5>

                    <p>Mitchell is an expert at the boring and repetitive. Naturally, this makes
                        playing the same
                        three notes on the drums for every song a breeze. With enough luck, he will
                        never have to
                        learn another note.</p>

                    <p>Mitchell likes to spend his free time wherever he can find peace and
                        silence.</p>

                    <h5>Beat Sampler</h5>

                    <p>Herbie is an experimentalist. He managed to live his whole life not hearing
                        a single note of classical music until once
                        he heard some Beethoven. After he heard it, he knew the world of hip hop
                        and classical needed to join.</p>

                    <p>He spents his time partying it up! Or down or sideways.</p>

                    <p>
                        Mohammad adds an eastern flare to the music by playing the oud. 
                        He fell in love with the oud at the age 
                        of 10 and they were not seperated since then.

                    <p>Mohammad enjoys to spend his time with friend and doing activities.</p>
